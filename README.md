# MOVIE-APP

This project is build in **React.js** and I've used **React-Router** for navigation, **Redux** for managing the state and I've styled this application with the use of **styled-components.** The design was made in **Figma**. </br> </br>
Live demo: [Movie-app](https://nataliadziedzic.github.io/movie-app/ "movie app")

## Motivation
---
I started this project to learn how to use Redux and styled-components, get some more practice in writing code in React as well as to make sure that I will create my next project faster and that it will always be better than the previous one.
